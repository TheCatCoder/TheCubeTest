        <h3>Materials in Your Desert</h3>
        <p>When you thought of what your cube, and ladder looked like, the material that they were made from was one of the things that you thought of. This is important since the material that your elements were made from is one of the primary things to evaluate after you've taken the test.</p>
        <p>Below, there are a couple pictures that you can hover over with your mouse to get an idea of what significance the materials in your desert have and how you could interpret those materials.</p>

        <div class="backgroundPicture" style="background-image: url(WoodTexture.jpg);">
            <div class="textInside">If your desert's cube or ladder were made out of natural materials, such as wood, this can indicate warm or natural feeling relationships associated with those things.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="backgroundPicture" style="background-image: url(Metal.jpg);">
            <div class="textInside">If your desert's cube or ladder were made out of very hard or cold materials, such as Metal or Stone, this can indicate coldness or rigity with those things.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="backgroundPicture" style="background-image: url(Water.jpg);">
            <div class="textInside">If your desert's cube or ladder were made out of liquid materials, such as water or gel, this can indicate flexibility or broad-mindedness with those things.</div>
